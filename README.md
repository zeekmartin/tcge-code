## Overview

This repository contains the computational verification scripts supporting the TCGE manuscript. All claims of computational verification in the paper can be reproduced by running these scripts.

TCGE proposes that physical reality emerges from a single variational principle: realized configurations are those that globally minimize incompatibilities within a constraint network, without presupposing spacetime, fields, or dynamics.

## Scripts and Corresponding Manuscript Sections

| Script | Manuscript Section | What It Verifies |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|

| `tcge_lorentzian_signature.py` | §4.2 (Table 1) | Lorentzian signature (−,+,+,+) emerges from directed constraint asymmetry; light cone structure |
| `tcge_gravity_einstein.py` | §4.3, §4.4, Appendix E | Gravitational potential ∝ 1/r; Poisson equation from minimization; G₀₀ = κT₀₀ correspondence |
| `tcge_gap3_causal_structure.py` | §6.3 (Table 2) | Symmetry breaking; foliated causal structure; cycle analysis by centrality measure |

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- SciPy (for `tcge_gravity_einstein.py` only)

Install:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy
```

## Running the Code

Each script is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
# Metric axioms verification (50 random models, N=6 to 30)
python tcge_metric_verification.py

# Lorentzian signature emergence (3+1D model)
python tcge_lorentzian_signature.py

# Gravity and Einstein equations (1D model with mass)
python tcge_gravity_einstein.py

# Foliated causal structure / Gap #3 analysis
python tcge_gap3_causal_structure.py
```

Each script prints results to stdout and saves detailed output to a JSON file in the working directory.

## Expected Results

### Metric Axioms (`tcge_metric_verification.py`)
- **50/50 models pass** all three axioms
- Tested on random graphs with N = 6 to 30 atoms, density 0.3–0.6

### Lorentzian Signature (`tcge_lorentzian_signature.py`)
- Diagonal metric: g = diag(−0.44, +1.00, +1.00, +1.00) — Minkowski signature
- **100% Lorentzian** across 20 random seeds
- Light cones emerge correctly: temporal neighbours timelike, spatial neighbours spacelike

### Gravity and Einstein Equations (`tcge_gravity_einstein.py`)
- Gravitational potential correlates with 1/r (r > 0.99)
- Discrete Laplacian peaks at mass position (Poisson equation)
- G₀₀ ∝ T₀₀ verified in weak-field regime
- Gravitational redshift observed

### Causal Structure (`tcge_gap3_causal_structure.py`)
- Symmetry breaking: |α| → 0.99 (asymmetric weights preferred)
- Eigenvector centrality produces ~0 cycles (vs ~13.5 for degree centrality)
- Cycle reduction: ~95–100% with enriched centrality measures
- DAG rate approaches 100% with eigenvector centrality

## Limitations and Transparency

These scripts verify the framework's predictions on **toy models** (N = 6 to 100 atoms). They demonstrate that the mathematical mechanisms work as described but do not constitute proofs that the mechanisms scale to physical reality. The manuscript discusses these limitations explicitly (Sections 8 and 11).

**AI Collaboration:** Mathematical formalizations in the manuscript were developed in collaboration with AI systems (Claude by Anthropic and ChatGPT by OpenAI), used as tools for calculation and verification. The conceptual framework, choice of problems, and critical evaluation of results are the author's responsibility throughout. All computational results are independently reproducible via the scripts in this repository.
